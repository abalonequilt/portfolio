description: Over the course of a summer, I worked as a game designer for iLab through MIT's MISTI Mexico program. iLab is a startup teaching lab and incubator based in Xalapa, Mexico. <br><br> My role was to take their entrepreneurial teaching curriculum and gamify it into a board game that could be taken anywhere in the world. <br><br> The video below does a good job of showcasing my time at iLab. Feel free to change the subtitles to whatever language suits you best.
