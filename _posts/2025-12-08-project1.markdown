description: This was a final project developed for the class CMS.611, using the theme "Big and Small". I worked with six other people on this project. In order to fit the theme, we decided to create a game in which players would use their phones as controls while a bigger screen showed all the action. <br><br>This project involved a lot of networking using Unity3D's Photon API. Other than that the gameplay was that of a standard space shooter game, with progressive waves and a central spinning 'core' serving as a boss.
