description: This was a game made in a ten week "purposeful games" workshop hosted by the MIT Game Lab and in partnership with the Shenkar College of Engineering. My team consisted of Michal Skurnik as a game and level designer, Micky Hoz as a programmer, Shiri Blumenthal as an artist, and myself as a programmer. <br><br> Shaky Shack is a building game set in a dumpyard, where people's unwanted belongings becomes someone else's treasure and home. The game shows the experiences of the dumplings, helpless creatures in the junkyard. During the game the player needs to build a shelter that will help the dumplings survive against multiple disasters.
