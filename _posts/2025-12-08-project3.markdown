description: Using the Phaser 3 web framework, I built a 2D game prototype that uses the A* pathfinding algorithm as a basic AI for enemies. I built this as a rudimentary prototype for a larger game that I am working on, and the player has a controller that allows them to traverse the level while a pursuer follows the player's avatar'. <br><br>Each enemy has a target and a pursuer, so all the characters follow each other in a chain. This prototype also has a circle graphic that fills up the closer a player is to a target and also points in the target's direction. The player can select targets, and 'kill' them for points if the correct target is eliminated. <br><br> Pressing tab also brings up a leaderboard, but enemy AI's are not currently programmed to attack or to collect points.
